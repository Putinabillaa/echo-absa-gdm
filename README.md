# Echo-ABSA-GDM

Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) + Group Decision Making (GDM) pipeline for measuring **echo chambers** in Indonesian social media conversations.

The pipeline combines:

* **Preprocessing**
* **Domain-independent ABSA** (Gemini or Double Propagation)
* **Interaction graph construction**
* **Community detection** (Louvain / METIS)
* **Consensus calculation (GDM)**

This project was developed as part of my **undergraduate thesis** in
**Teknik Informatika, Sekolah Teknik Elektro dan Informatika, Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB).**

## üìñ Abstract

Social media has become an important space for Indonesians to interact and form opinions, but communication patterns often create echo chambers that reinforce polarization. However, echo chamber studies in Indonesia remain limited to manual analyses or network-based approaches without considering content sentiment.

This study develops a model to measure echo chambers in Indonesian social media conversations using domain-independent Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) and consensus metrics within the Group Decision Making (GDM) framework. The proposed pipeline consists of five stages: text preprocessing, domain-independent ABSA, interaction graph construction, community detection, and GDM consensus calculation.

Results show that a zero-shot generative LLM (Gemini-2.5-flash) achieves the highest performance, producing Echo Chamber Ratio (ECR) values consistent with prior expert analyses and statistically significant under null model testing.

## üöÄ Installation

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/echo-absa-gdm.git
cd echo-absa-gdm
pip install .
```

Requires **Python 3.8+**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

### CLI Mode

Run the full pipeline from the command line:

```bash
main \
  --community_input data/corpus_final/for_echo_chamber_detection/example.csv \
  --absa_aspect data/corpus_final/for_absa/aspects.csv \
  --workdir pipeline_out \
  --model gemini \
  --model_name gemini-2.5-flash \
  --algo louvain
```

* `--community_input`: CSV with at least `id,text` columns
* `--absa_aspect`: CSV with `aspect,desc` columns
* `--model`: `gemini` (LLM) or `dp` (double propagation)
* `--algo`: Community detection algorithm (`louvain` or `metis`)

Outputs include:

* `absa_community.csv` ‚Üí merged sentiment + community data
* `consensus.txt` ‚Üí consensus results
* `community_graph.gml` ‚Üí interaction graph

---

### GUI Mode

Run the interactive GUI with [NiceGUI](https://nicegui.io/):

```bash
python main_gui.py
```

* Upload input files (community CSV, aspect CSV, optional lexicon CSV for DP)
* Configure model and community detection parameters
* Run the pipeline and view logs + results in the browser
